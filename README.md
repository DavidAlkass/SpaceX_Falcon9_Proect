## About the project ðŸš€
- The project was created as a capstone course during my Data Science Certification, the project came with a few skeletons and templates to save time and standardize the process.
- During the course of this project I got to deploy alot of my newfound knowledge and apply some of the languages and tools to deal with the challenges of that came along the way. 

### Short description
- In short, the course tasked us with researching and constructing a classification algorithm that would predict whether or not the stage one (base part of rocket) on the Falcon 9 from SpaceX would be able to land successfully (for reuse). We got to demonstrate and apply some of the skills and techniques that we learned during the previous courses such as: Data collection via API requests, Data collection done by webscraping, writing SQL queries, Visualization (Matplotlib, Folium, PlotlyDash), Data wrangling, Cleaning, Standardization and finally training and applying Machine Learning algorithms.  
- The entirety of my process is summarized in the PDF presentation labeled "IBM_Presentation_David_Alkass". 
- All notebooks, data files and other resources can be found by navigating through the folders in this repository.
